/*

Basically, when a starting number of coins...

... play three machines, each after the other, a, b, then c.  

Then back to a again, and so on.

Machine A pays 30 coins every 35 turns
Machine B pays 60 coins every 100 turns
Machine C 9 coins every 10 turns

I need to keep track of the number of plays before coins run out (reach 0).
